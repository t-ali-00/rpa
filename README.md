# Data Curation for Protein Interface Analysis
This repository contains code for curating and embedding residue-level data for protein interface analysis. The scripts streamline the integration of various data types, ensuring compatibility and accuracy for downstream analysis.

#Overview
Residue-Level Data Integration:
- Combines residue-level attributes (e.g., secondary structure, accessibility) with the original dataframe.
- Utilises direct mappings for seamless integration.
Evolutionary/Conservation Analysis:
- Handles alignment shifts due to sequence variations (e.g., insertions, deletions).
- Accurately maps conservation scores back to their corresponding PI positions.
